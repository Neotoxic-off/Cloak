# Cloak
ðŸ¤¹ Cloak is a DLL made to simplify hooks

## About
- Cloak is a project made to simplify dll building to reverse process memory
- By default Cloak provides simple debugger and presence hidder (more comming soon)
- Cloak doesn't provide any offset
- Cloak must be rebuild for your own usage and edit the files

## Features
- Auto hooking
- Auto unhook
- Auto rehook
- Auto module management
- Auto pattern scanning
- Keys interactions

## Usage
- Edit the offsets in `include/constants/offsets.h`
- Edit the modules in `include/constants/modules.h`
- Go in `src/user/sample.cpp`
- Set you **game module** the **offset** and the **method** (can be edited / created / deleted)
```CPP
void Sample::Run()
{
    this->factory.cheats = {
        Cheat(MODULE_GAME_ASSEMBLY, OFFSET_SAMPLE_1, DummyZero, nullptr),
        Cheat(MODULE_GAME_ASSEMBLY, OFFSET_SAMPLE_2, DummyZero, nullptr),
        Cheat(MODULE_GAME_ASSEMBLY, OFFSET_SAMPLE_3, DummyZero, nullptr),
        Cheat(MODULE_GAME_ASSEMBLY, OFFSET_SAMPLE_4, DummyZero, nullptr),
        Cheat(MODULE_GAME_ASSEMBLY, OFFSET_SAMPLE_5, DummyZero, nullptr)
    };

    this->factory.Initialize();
}
```
- Compile the project for x64
- Inject `Cloak.dll`
